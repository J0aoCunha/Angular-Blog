This is great news for Angular developers, but there is still a lot of work to be done to make Angular apps more performant and SEO friendly.",

        "Text2": "While Hydration and Resumability are great for improving the performance of our apps, they are not enough. Having to server-side render the application for each user request is not efficient and can be expensive for large applications with a lot of users.",
