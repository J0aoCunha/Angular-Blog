            We are delighted to announce that we’ve collaborated with the online interactive code learning platform
            Sololearn to develop an introductory course to Angular. The course is available for free on Sololearn’s
            platform to anyone who wants to learn Angular.

            With hands-on coding exercises and projects, learners get practical experience working with real
            examples of
            Angular code. They’ll learn the fundamentals of Angular, such as components, routing, and more.
